=============================

ReportLab-FlexBox is a implementation of the css FlexBox for reportlab. Simply layout manager inspired by the powerful flexbox, intended to reduce the tedious work of positioning and sizing flowables using the ``Wrap(availWidth, availHeight)`` method. Additionally the package adds some basic css inspired styling options such as paddings, margins, background and borders.

Reportlab-flexbox has two main components.

1. The :ref:`flex_item <FlexItem>`, a flowable with does two things. Firstly it provides an automatic wrapping function and secondly it provides some basic css-inspired styling.
2. The :ref:`flex_box <FlexBox>`, a layout manager (which it self is also a FlexItem) which positions given Flowables/FlexItems.
